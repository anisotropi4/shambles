# Pictures at a (Rail Transport) Exhibition
Following a minor success with a rail passenger data flow visualization in January 2024 using FY2018-19  ORR rail passenger journeys, I thought I'd talk about it.
In 2023 UK Office of Road and Rail published a new passenger flow dataset that allows anyone to explore almost 1 billion journeys from every one of its more than 2,580 train stations in Great Britain, and updated this to include all journeys from 2018 to 2023
This talk looks at using this data along with other open datasets to host a visualisation for each station, and an aggregated view of rail travel in Britain, also known as the ‘monster over London’.
This goes through the background to the publication, its impact both in the media and on me, and what could be cool stuff to do after the event.
All code and the latest iteration of the data and images is on [GitHub here](https://github.com/anisotropi4/kingfisher).
