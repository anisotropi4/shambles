# Jet* Boy, Jet Girl* (Ça train pour moi) *train

One of the ugly issues around decarbonisation is the failure of the transport to get better, mostly because people need to get out of planes and cars. While cycling and walking are great, if you want to get from Stockholm to Leeds you might something a bit faster.

Using data science™ this talk will make the case for a high-speed railway powered using renewable electricity as a really efficient way to travel about Europe, and using on population and geography data will use electronic-crayons to look at what an ideal, fully-automated European luxury high-speed rail network might look like. While trying to answering questions like "Where we are today?" and "Where we do we need to be tomorrow?"

Those interested in data-visualisation, network and graph creation, rail and public transport, or crayons should come along. Plane enthusiasts maybe less so
